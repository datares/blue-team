# blue-team

Using kickstarter data from Kaggle (gathered as of 01/2018), our team investigated the factors that contribute to a successful campaign.

The main factors we looked into included:

Time elapsed between the launch date and the date the goal was reached (Is there a certain time frame where campaigns are the most popular? Discuss summary of distribution of successes over time)

Most successful categories (most popular / most number of successes, highest success rate)

Funding goal amount (is there a limit to how high people can aim? Is there an ideal goal amount that has highest rates of success?)

Number of backers (how many people are successful campaigns usually backed by, how does this compare to the median of all campaigns? Is there an ideal number of backers?)

What differentiates a successful campgain with an almost-successful campaign (within 10% of its goal)
